#' @description Calculates an estimate of how many PCs cover most of the variance in a dataset.
#'
#' @param seurat_object A seurat object
#' @param slot A dimensional reduction present in the seurat object

#' @return minimum of co1 and co2 (and prints co1 and co2)

calc_PCs_estimate <- function(seurat_object, slot = "pca") {
  #https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq/lessons/elbow_plot_metric.html
  # Determine percent of variation associated with each PC
  pct <- seurat_object[["pca"]]@stdev / sum(seurat_object[["pca"]]@stdev) * 100

  # Calculate cumulative percents for each PC
  cumu <- cumsum(pct)

  # Determine which PC exhibits cumulative percent greater than 90% and % variation associated with the PC as less than 5
  co1 <- which(cumu > 90 & pct < 5)[1]

  #co1
  #The first metric returns PC42 as the PC matching these requirements. Letâ€™s check the second metric, which identifies the PC where the percent change in variation between consecutive PCs is less than 0.1%:

  # Determine the difference between variation of PC and subsequent PC
  co2 <- sort(which((pct[1:length(pct) - 1] - pct[2:length(pct)]) > 0.1), decreasing = T)[1] + 1

  # last point where change of % of variation is more than 0.1%.
  #co2
  #This second metric returns PC14. Usually, we would choose the minimum of these two metrics as the PCs covering the majority of the variation in the data.

  # Minimum of the two calculation
  pcs <- min(co1, co2)

  print(paste0("co1 = ", co1, ", co2 = ", co2))

  return(pcs)
